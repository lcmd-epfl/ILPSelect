The main.py combines all files of scripts/ to do the following.

- read target names from targets/targets.csv file. The corresponding .xyz file should be present in targets/.
- read the config script for all parameters: database, representation, algorithm-specific parameters, learning curve parameters
- generate the representations if not present ({rep}-{target}.npz and {rep}-{database}.npz) and save to data/. The database must be in molekuehl/{database}/.
- compute fragment subsets using different techniques (indices of database)
	- subset selection by algorithm:
		- generate model and write it to models/ OR read it and modify it's parameters if possible (penalty changed eg)
		- solve model and output subset to rankings/ with prefix algo_, and solution of ILP to solutions/
	- subset selection by SML:
		- output subset to rankings/ with prefix sml_
	- subset selection random:
		- output subset to rankings/ with prefix random_
- compute the learning curve of each subset and save to learning_curves/
- draw the learning curves and save to plots/

TODO before first run:
	- to use algo_model and algo_subset, the molekuehl folder should be added to the pythonpath.
	Example:
	>>> export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/home/haeberle/molekuehl/"
	Add this line at the end of your .bashrc file to add it systematically.

	- create folder models/. The files it contains are large and thus in the .gitignore.
	>>> mkdir models

	- verify that the folder molekuehl/{database} exists, that it contains .xyz files and their energy described in an energies.csv file.

REQUIREMENTS:
	- python3 modules: numpy, pandas, qml, sklearn, plotly, kaleido (to save figures of plotly), pickle, json, os
